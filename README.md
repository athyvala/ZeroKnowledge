Cloud session sharing for friends with access request system

## Features
- **Save & Load Sessions**: Save browser sessions (cookies) to the cloud and load them on any device
- **Friends System**: Add friends and build a trusted network for session sharing
- **Friends-Only Access Requests**: Request access to specific URLs/domains from your friends
- **Session Management**: View, delete, and manage all your saved sessions
- **Secure Authentication**: User accounts with JWT authentication

## New: Friends-Based Access Request System
Users can now build a network of trusted friends and request access to specific URLs like Netflix from them. This creates a secure, social approach to session sharing. Perfect for:
- Building a trusted network of friends for session sharing
- Requesting Netflix/streaming service access from friends
- Getting access to premium sites from trusted contacts
- Sharing work-related authenticated sessions within your team

### How it Works:
1. **Add Friends**: Send friend requests via email
2. **Build Network**: Accept/decline incoming friend requests
3. **Request Access**: Ask friends for access to specific sites
4. **Approve/Deny**: Manage incoming requests from friends
5. **Secure Sharing**: Only friends can request access to your sessions
